          <p>
            Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, India, was a visionary scientist, educator, and the 11th President of India. Known as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India," Kalam played a pivotal role in India's space and defense programs. After earning degrees in aeronautical engineering, he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and later the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). His leadership in the development of ballistic missile technology, particularly the successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, earned him widespread acclaim. Dr. Kalam's humility, wisdom, and dedication to shaping a brighter future for India made him a beloved figure, and his legacy lives on as an inspiration for generations.
